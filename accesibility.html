                improving the accessibility and usability of its website. </p>
              <p key="home.accessibility.general.p2">Everyone should have the same opportunities to travel. We recognise
                that some website users may need digital accessibility adjustments as they can find accessing online
                content challenging. Whether it is a temporary need due to an accident or injury, a long-term
                requirement caused by a lifelong condition, or simply a byproduct of the natural aging process, some
                website users may struggle to access information on the internet the same way as others.</p>

              <h4 class="terms-headings" key="home.accessibility.commitment.title">Our commitment</h4>
              <p key="home.accessibility.commitment.p1">EclipsoAir strives to ensure that our website services and
                content are accessible to persons with disabilities including users of screen reader technology. </p>
              <p key="home.accessibility.commitment.p2">Our aim is to ensure that our website is designed, operated and
                developed to ensure that everyone can perceive, navigate, understand, and interact with its content and
                features, providing an inclusive user experience for all users, regardless of ability or disability.</p>
              <p key="home.accessibility.commitment.p3">We will continue to strive to employ the correct structure,
                layout, and features to account for the diverse needs of individuals with various access requirements,
                comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<strong>WCAG</strong>>) and meet the relevant local
                and national legal standards and regulations.</p>

            <div class="content">
              <h4 class="terms-headings" key="home.accessibility.doing.title">What are we doing?</h4>
              <p key="home.accessibility.doing.p1">To accomplish this, EclipsoAir has engaged or will from time to time
                engage a web accessibility consultant to help test or EclipsoAir will test internally, remediate and
                maintain our website in-line with the WCAG. </p>
              <p key="home.accessibility.doing.p2">To help us make our website a positive place for everyone, we have
                been using WCAG 2.1. WCAG covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible
                as it addresses accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Adoption
                of WCAG should also bring the website into conformance with other applicable disabilities regulations or
                legislation as following these guidelines will also often make web content more usable to users in
                general.</p>
              <p key="home.accessibility.doing.p3">The intention in seeking to implement WCAG is to seek to make content
                more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and
                low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and
                combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations.
                However, this will not address every user need for people with these disabilities.</p>

                usability are ongoing. While we strive to make the website as accessible as possible some issues can be
                encountered by different assistive technology as the range of assistive technology is wide and varied.
