              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.wifi.p1">
                Be aware that public WiFi and hotspots are not always secure and might be accessible by others. We
                recommend that you only use protected WiFi networks with a unique password or your device’s mobile data
                network, especially if logging into accounts that hold sensitive data.
              </p>
              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.wifi.p2">
                Anyone using a WiFi network that has a shared password or is not password protected will be vulnerable
                to criminal attempts to intercept your signal to collect your passwords, credit card information and
                more.

              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.browsing.p1">
                When browsing the Internet or logging into sites, you should make sure the website is secure by checking
                that the website’s address starts with “https”, rather than “http”. Do also check that the site has a
                padlock icon in the URL field as that indicates use of encryption on that website to prevent
                interception by criminals.
              </p>
              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.browsing.p2">
                Always verify you are on a genuine EclipsoAir website, social media page and that the connection is
                secure before entering your personal information such as passwords, credit card number or other private
                information.
              </p>
              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.browsing.p3">
                Be aware that there are fake websites, sometimes via links and websites directing you to websites that
                try to mimic the genuine one. These fake websites seek to harvest your personal data and details. Look
                out for errors, bad grammar, incorrect logos, dubious branding or other suspicious signs.

                Security</h4>
              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.passwords.p1">
                The best way to keep yourself protected is to use strong unique passwords for all online accounts,
                taking particular care with your email accounts used in registering for, buying goods and services or
                that holds your personal information.
              </p>
              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.passwords.p2">
                The best unique passwords are longer and more unusual as this makes it harder to be cracked by
                fraudsters looking to compromise your security as weak passwords can be cracked in seconds.
              </p>
              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.passwords.p3">
                You should try to avoid the most common passwords that can be easily guessed including those that
                contain personal information like pet names, children or family names or significant dates, etc., etc.
                If possible, do set up 2 factor or multifactor authentication on your important accounts.

                It is important to keep your computers, phones, tablets, and smart devices up to date with the latest
                software, operating systems and applications to increase your protection chances against attacks that
                often target those with weaker security.

              <p data-i18n="home.security.guidance.phishing.p2">
                We recommend that you never open links or email attachments from people or organisations you do not know
                or where the message is suspicious, odd or unexpected. The most common forms of fraud today involve
                Phishing (emails) or Smishing (texts or social media) to try to trick you into providing personal or
                other information.
