              <p key="home.cookies.what.p1">Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that may be
                placed on your browser, computer or device when you visit websites. Also known as browser cookies or
                tracking cookies, cookies are small, often encrypted text files, located in browser directories. </p>
              <p key="home.cookies.what.p2">Cookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly, cookies can
                store ordering information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember
                all the items the user put in the shopping cart. They are used by web developers to help users navigate
                their websites efficiently and perform certain functions.</p>

            <div class="content py-3">
              <h4 class="terms-headings" key="home.cookies.types.title">There are different types of cookies!</h4>
              <p key="home.cookies.types.p1">Session cookies are some cookies that may be temporary and stay on your
                device for the duration of your browsing session only. In essence, once you close your browser, the
                session cookies will be deleted. Session cookies are also used by the server to store information about
                user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on the server's pages. By default,
                web pages really don't have any 'memory'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the
                user doesn't have to remember or start navigating the site all over again.</p>
              <p key="home.cookies.types.p2">Persistent cookies are some cookies that may be more persistent or
                permanent in order to remember your preferences in the future, unless you choose to delete them.
                Persistent or tracking cookies are also employed to store user preferences. Many websites allow the user
                to customise how information is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the site
                easier to navigate and/or let the user leave a part of the user's personality at the site.</p>
